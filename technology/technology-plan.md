#### Preface

##### Vision for Technology

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library will be the community's link to ideas, information, and resources, utilizing current technologies and high speed Internet access to improve an information portal where residents will be able to access the Library 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through its website and electronic resources.

##### Technology Mission Statement

1. All new applicants should be highly computer literate.
2. Regular technology training should be a priority for all staff.
3. The Director should attend events and/or review publications on software news, particularly open-source solutions.

#### Technology Plan

This plan is intended to guide technological development in the Library for the next five years. It will support the minimal needs of the Library's mission statement, stimulate thought and discussion about the technological needs of our community, provide structure for planning and budgeting in the next five years, provide a base to plan for technology in building expansion and finally, meet the criteria of the FCC for application for the E-rate discount for telecommunications.

1. GOAL: Routine Repair and Replacement

	Maintain the current equipment and devices, replacing and repairing as necessary.

	1. Objective: Equipment Replacement - Review Annually

		Since low-performance workstations can easily run Ubuntu, workstations should be on a 5-10 year replacement plan unless a given workstation is performing at a reasonable performance measured by user experience (number of complaints recorded) which could extend this limit to 15 years. Workstation components should be replaced as necessary. Printers should be replaced as needed.

	2. Objective: Budget - Review Annually

		Budget for the purchase and maintenance of all equipment.

2. GOAL: Printing and Media

	Enable patrons to print, scan, fax, and manage personal media seamlessly on all patron terminals.

	1. Objective: Print Job Management - End of 2020

		Do a cost-savings report on print management services. Would holding print jobs for payment actually save money or would it simply be an inconvenience for patrons and staff members compared to simple Patron policy enforcement?

	2. Objective: Scanning availability - End of 2019

		Currently only two computers have access to the scanners. Do a feasibility report and implement any measures allowing all computers to connect with scanners on the network. Replacing the old USB scanners with networked scanners would be a moderate one-time investment.


3. GOAL: Website

	Promote, maintain, and improve the Library website, expanding usefulness, functionality, and access to current information.

	1. Objective: Local Hosting - End of 2020

		Currently the Library uses Wix for webhosting. This is far from ideal. Wix's webtools are slow and overly complicated. The Library's server is more than suited to hosting the website locally. The site design is also very outdated. The website could integrate completely with the Library's OPAC, the public event calendar, etc. The website should embrace Web 2.0 with tagging, dynamic content, user generated content, and Apps.

	2. Objective: Social Media - End of 2021

		Currently the Library uses Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, the Library website, and email to promote Library events and services. It is an impossible task to keep up with everything when using separate platforms for everything. Research into unified publishing platforms such as Hootsuite and Tweetdeck would greatly simplify and steamline publishing.		

#### Evaluation

This plan will be reviewed yearly by the Library Board. Since technology is constantly evolving, this plan is considered framework which will guide, but not limit, the Library's use of technology.
