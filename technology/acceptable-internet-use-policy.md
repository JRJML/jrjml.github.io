### 8.2 Acceptable Internet Use Policy
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Introduction

The mission of the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is to provide for the informational, educational, and recreational needs of Appomattox County residents. In keeping with this mission, the Library provides public access to computers and the Internet, which offers current global resources to meet these needs.

The J. Robert Jamerson Library does not control the information available on the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its content. The Internet takes patrons outside Library walls and into an electronic world of information, which has all the excitements and risks of the world at large. Much of the information may be valuable, but not all Internet resources are reliable, current, or accurate. Patrons may find opinions, ideas, and images, which are controversial, divergent, inflammatory, and offensive. By providing access, the Library does not endorse or sanction the content or point of view of information or commentary found on the Internet. Patrons are encouraged to be critical consumers and to evaluate information carefully.

Library staff will assist patrons in accessing the internet and will provide pointers to resources which have been judged to be reliable. However, each user is responsible for his or her own search. Staff cannot provide in-depth personal training in the use of the Internet or of personal computers. 

The Internet is a global network of thousands of smaller computer networks. The use of standardized rules, or protocols, which make it possible for different computers to communicate with each other, allows for sharing of information among these networks.

#### Access and Use

To use the computers at the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library, patrons must sign-in at the circulation desk. Once registered, a patron is guaranteed a thirty-minute session, which may be extended if no other patrons are waiting. Additionally, a patron may sign up for a session up to a week in advance. Computers will not be available 15 minutes before closing. Patrons may print electronic files or download them to floppy disks, which are available for purchase at the circulation desk for $1. Printed pages cost $0.25 per page.
	1. All patrons must read and agree to abide by the terms of this Acceptable Computer & Internet Use Policy
	2. A patron under the age of 18 must have a parent's or guardian's signature to sign up to use a computer and/or the Internet. The parent or guardian needs to be present in the library to sign permission and must present identification at that time. The Library cannot and will not decide what ideas or information children should be exposed to. Parents or guardians are solely responsible for their child's, and only their child's, use of the Internet.
	3. Children under the age of 13 must be under the direct supervision of a parent or guardian when using the Internet.
	4. Patrons with overdue library materials and/or a fine balance are not eligible to use the Library's computers until the library materials have been returned and/or the fine balance has been paid.

#### Rights of Patrons

The standards of intellectual freedom and confidentiality endorsed by the Americal Library Association and incorporated into the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library policies for traditional media shall apply also to the use of electronic media, including the Internet. Library staff will treat the contents of electronic filels as private and confidential. However, security is technically difficult to achieve in a public area. Electronic transactions of information and viewing screens could become public. As a result, the Library cannot guarantee privacy or confidentiality. Any inspection of electronic files, and any action based upon such inspection, will be governed by applicable federal and state laws as well as J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library policies.

#### Unauthorized Use

Computing resources may only be used for legal purposes by the public and staff. Examples of unacceptable purposes include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Harassment of other uses
- Libeling or slandering other users
- Destruction of or damage to equipment, software, or data belonging to the Library or other users
- Disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.
- Unauthorized copying of copyright-protected material. U.S. Copyright law prohibits the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted materials, except as permitted by the principles of "fair use". Users may not copy or distribute electronic materials (including electronic mail, text, images, programs, or data) without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. Any responsibility for any consequences of copyright infringement lies with the user; the Library expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility arising from access to or use of information obtained through its electronic systems, or any consequences thereof.
- Accessing and viewing sexually explicit material. Any library staff member who observes a patron viewing such material will direct that patron to remove the material from the computer screen and refrain from viewing such material in the future.

Computing resources should be used in accordance with the ethical standards of the Library. Examples of unacceptable use (some of which may have legal consequences) include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Violation of computer system security
- Unauthorized use of computer accounts, access codes, or network identification numbers assigned to others
- Use of computer communications facilities in ways that unnecessarily impede the computing activities of others (such as randomly initiating electronic communications of e-mail exchanges, overuse of interactive network utilities, and so forth)
- Violation of software license agreements
- Violation of network usage policies and regulations (such as installing software on library computers and changing software settings and setups)
- Violation of another user's privacy

Violations may result in loss of computer and Internet access and Library privileges. Unlawful activities will be dealt with in a serious and appropriate manner, in accordance with local, state, and federal law
