	1. Have a regular Appomattox County Library card in good standing.
	2. Be at least 18 years old.
	3. Have no fines on your library record.
	4. Must have an ILL Policy form on file, signed by the borrower.
	5. Has not previously abused the ILL service by habitually returning materials late, damaged, or failing to pick up material without notification.

5. We do not borrow new books, less than 6 months old.
6. We do not borrow audio-visual materials at all.
7. We do not borrow books published before 1930.
8. We charge $2.75 per ILL request to cover our postage costs for books. If you request microfilm we will charge you whatever the postage costs. If we cannot fill your request, you will not be charged.
9. Although we apply to free lenders first, some libraries charge. Please specify the maximum amount you are willing to pay for loan/copies. Loan charges may range from $2.50-$20.00. Genealogical materials may require pre-payment of fees. If the lending library charges such a fee, it must also be paid before the material is picked up. We accept checks or money orders made out to the lending library. We cannot accept cash or credit/debit cards.
10. Library cards must be present to pick up materials. Returns must be made to a member of staff only. Do not return the book in the book drop.
11. The overdue fine is $1.00 per day. All ILL items must be returned to Library on or before the day they are due. Any book left in the book drop will be charged a late fee for that day.
12. Borrowing privileges will be suspended for six months for three late items in 24 months, or one return more than five days late.
13. You are responsible for replacement for damaged or lost items. The lending library sets the cost for replacement of their materials.
14. All interlibrary loan fines and fees are recorded on your library record.

I have read the above policies and will comply with them.
