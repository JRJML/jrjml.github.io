		The audio cassette collection includes fiction, self-help, and instructional tapes. Unabridged versions of fiction titles are preferred.

		Microforms are acquired to augment the newspaper, periodical, and reference collections, to save space, to provide specialized materials not otherwise available, and to make the most cost effective use of library resources.

	2. Juvenile

		The children's collection aims to instill children an enjoyment of reading for pleasure and information by selecting materials to meet their particular and potential needs, interests, and abilities from infancy through age 12. A collection of fiction is separately organized for young adults of approximately 13 to 18 years of age. The specific aims of this collection are to recognize the needs and interests of young adults and to provide books in concert with their needs and interests of young adults and to provide books in concert with their needs and interests on a recreational level. The Library provides nonfiction for this age group within the general collection.

		Selections for inclusion in the children's and young adult collections are made based on the following additional criteria:

		1. Usefulness and appeal for age group
		2. Quality of illustrations and graphics
		3. Appropriateness of format, content, and style
		4. Suitability of subject matter or story for the intended users.
		5. School Curriculum Support

	3. Large Print

		Popular fiction titles and selected nonfiction titles are purchased in large print format for patrons with diminished visual capabilities.

	4. Local History and Genealogy

		The Library strives to attain a fair degree of comprehensiveness in printed materials related to Appomattox history. Materials are collected which contribute to a body of knowledge of Appomattox's social, cultural, religious, economic, and political life. Kinds of material collected include: books, newspapers, pamphlets, periodicals, public documents, maps, atlases, diaries, correspondence, business and organizational records, photographs, calendars, scrapbooks, family histories, school annuals, cemetary records, and other primary research materials.

Magazines, with the exception of the newest issue, can be checked out. When replaced by a newer issue, periodicals are kept in a secondary location for a period of time before being discarded:

		- Magazines - 1 year
		
		- Newspapers - 1 month

#### 8. Weeding

1. The collection is systematically weeded to eliminate unnecessary items such as outdated or superceded materials, items no longer of interest or demand, duplicates and worn or damaged materials.

2. Criteria used to remove materials from the collection are the same as those used to select materials (i.e., items which no longer meet the selection criteria are removed). Additional guidelines are outlined in the book "Evaluating and Weeding in Small and Medium Sized Public Libraries: the CREW Method", by Joseph Segal.

#### 9. Intellectual Freedom

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library recognizes the pluralistic nature of its community and varied backgrounds and needs of all citizens. It also recognizes that many library materials are controversial and may offend some patrons. However, it is not the library's responsibility to practice censorship. No library materials will be excluded from the collection because of the race, nationality, sex, political, social, or religious views of the author. Censorship is purely an individual matter and while anyone is free to reject for him- or herself materials of which he or she does not approve, censorship cannot be exercised to restrict the freedom of use and/or access to others.

In its selection of books and other materials, the J. Robert. Jamerson Memorial Library subscribes fully to the principles adopted by the American Library Association in its Library Bill of Rights and endorses its stand that freedom to read is essential to our democracy. It is the function and the duty of the public library to provide means, whenever possible, through which all persons may have free access to thinking on all sides of all issues. Copies of the Library Bill of Rights, the Freedom to Read Statement, and the Freedom to View Statement are attached to this document.

Selection is based on the criteria given throughout this policy document and does not represent an endorsement by the library of any theory, idea, or lifestyle. Processing and shelving of materials in no way reflects a value judgment of the materials. There will be no labeling of items or of cataloging records to indicated a point of view or bias.

The responsibility for the reading of children rests with parents and legal guardians. Selection of materials for the adult collection is not restricted by the possibility that children may obtain materials their parents consider inappropriate.

Individuals or groups objecting to any portion of the library's collection may initiate a formal request for reexamination by filling out a Request for Reconsideration of Library Material. The final decision for retention or removal rests with the Library Director and the Library Board of Trustees.

#### 10. Reconsideration of Materials

1. If a patron objects to the Library's ownership of a particular item or items, the patron will be offered the opportunity to complete a "Request for Reconsideration of Library Material" form.
