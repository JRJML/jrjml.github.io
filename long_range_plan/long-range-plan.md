# Long Range Plan
### 14.1 Long Range Plan
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Forward

The Library Long Range Plan is a document that should clearly outline the expected progress for the Library in the long term. Such documentation is immensely valuable as it provides patrons, staff, and administrators with a road map both of what the Library needs and what it hopes to achieve. These needs and hopes are defined as objectives and goals. These, in turn, reflect the various facets of the library's overall purpose and mission.
