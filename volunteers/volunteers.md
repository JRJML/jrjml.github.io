[< Table of Contents][0]

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library Volunteer Program is designed to expand and enhance public service to the community. Volunteers generally provide support services to paid staff and/or work on special projects. Volunteers learn more about the Library and its place in the community and observe first hand the way the Library serves the community's needs.

These are some kinds of work which have been done by library volunteers: storytelling to children; mending library materials; shelving returned materials; preparing clippings for vertical file; inspecting and repairing audiovisual materials.

1. Volunteers are selected based upon their qualifications and needs of hte Library at any given time.
2. Volunteers will be trained by Libary staff to perform specific duties and are expected to take directions from the Library staff.
3. Work schedules and specific time commitments will be arranged by each volunteer and the Library Director. Volunteers who cannot meet a scheduled work assignment must inform the Library Director in advance.
4. Volunteers are welcome to bring any concern, problem, or suggestion to the Library Director and to ask for any information needed to do the job more effectively.
5. The volunteer should keep an accurate record of the hours worked, recording them on the Library's volunteer Record form.

Therefore, volunteers may wish to keep an on-going record of transportation, parking, and other relevant expenses. (For more specific information, see IRS Publication 526, Charitable Contributions)

8. Volunteers may be removed from the Volunteer Program for poor performance, lack of available work, or violation of the Library's policies and procedures.
