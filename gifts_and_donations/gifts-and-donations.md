[< Table of Contents][0]

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is grateful for gifts, and its collection has been enriched by donations of materials as well as contributions. Through donors, the Library has been able to acquire materials which could not have been purchased otherwise.

#### 1. Monetary Donations

2. Library Materials - The Library accepts monetary donations for the purpose of purchasing library material consistent with the objectives of hte Library collections. Such money is deposited in the appropriate line item for expenditure by the Library Director.

3. Gift Book Program - The Library welcomes monetary contributions specifically for book purchases in memorial to or in honor of named individuals. In order that the Library can properly honor the generosity of the donor, a special form to record the information is used and should be completed by the donor.

4. All materials purchased with monetary donations shall be in accordance with the Library's policies and procedures. Undesignated gift funds may be used to purchase materials or other items.

#### 2. Donation of Library Materials

Books or other library materials purchased by the donor for presentation to the Library will be accepted provided they meet the Library's selection criteria. The decision to add a particular item to the collection rests with the Library Director. Materials which do not meet the Library's selection criteria shall be disposed of at the discretion of hte Library. Means of disposing of items not added to the collection in sale, donation to other institutions, and when necessary, destruction. Proceeds from materials offered at the Library book sale benefit the Library collection in general and/or other Library projects and services.

The Library Director can supply, upon request, a list of needed materials for consideration by the donor. The Library issues a receipt for items donated upon request but does not establish a monetary value for the donation. Receipt shows total items donated, not an inventory. If appropriate, gift book plates will be affixed to donated materials in order to satisfy a donor's request. Patrons wishing to receive a gift acknowledgement should leave his/her name, address, and description of donation.

#### 3. Donations of Decorative or Display Objects

1. Criteria for Accepting Gifts

In its mission, the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library has stated responsibility for providing knkowledge, ideas, and creative expression. These responsibilities are reflected in Library services, collection, programs, and the utilization of decorative and display objects within the Library.

The following points must be considered by the Library before accepting a gift of this kind:

  1. Evaluation of the object itself will be based upon several considerations:

      1. Does it conform to the general architecture of the building?

      2. Will it fit comfortably into the space available?

      3. Does the object make optimum use of the space available?

      4. Is the object appropriate to Library objectives, or would it be better elsewhere?

      5. Will it cost more to accept the gift than it is worth to the Library?

          1. Cost of insurance

          2. Cost of restoration

          3. Cost of display

          4. Cost of material and labor maintaining the gift

          5. Cost of disposing of it or storing it

    6. Is it generally acceptable to the Library Board of Trustees?

  2. No gift will be accepted by the Library unless it is freely given to the extent that the Library may:

    1. Dispose of the gift as it sees fit (selling it, disgarding it, or giving it away, etc.)

    2. Store the gift or move it to various locations.

2. Procedure for Accepting Gifts of Art

Initial evaluation of the gift to detetermine its usefulness to the Library will be made by the Library Director. The Library's Gift Policy will be explained. If both the Library and the donor wish to continute negotiations, authorities may be consulted to determine the merit of the gift. The donor may be required to obtain professional appraisal of the donation. The Library is not an authority which can place a monetary value on any gift. The final determination of the acceptability of all such gifts lies with the Library Board of Trustees.

#### 4. Accepting Gifts and Donations

#### 5. Processing Accepted Materials

1. Storage

Boxes should be clearly labeled, along with the current date, as "discard" (same as books that are culled from the collection) or "keep" - . The boxes should be organized according to whether they are "discard" or "keep". For instance, "discard" might be kept on a bottom shelf and "keep" might be kept on the top shelf.
