### 4.2 Disposal of Surplus Library materials
[< Table of Contents][0]

Library property (i.e., print and non-print materials, equipment, supplies, and/or personal property), which in the judgement of the Library Director is no longer necessary or useful for Library purposes, may be disposed of in the following manner:

1. Books and non-print materials from the Library's collection, or gift materials, may be discarded, sold, or, upon the approval of the Library Board of Trustees, be given to local philanthropic, educational, cultural, government, or other not-for-profit organizations.

2. Any other surplus items having an individual current value of less than $100 may, at the discretion of the Library Director, be discarded, turned in on new equipment, or made available for sale.

3. In the case of individual surplus items having current value of more than $100 but less than $1,000 the Library Board of Trustees may authorize a trade-in of such items on new equipment or sale of such items.

4. No favoritism shall be shown to members of the Library Board of Trustees or members of their immediate families, who make bids on or purchase any Library item declared surplus.

5. Any property having a unit value of more than $1,000 but less than $2,500 will be displayed at the Library, and a public notice of its availability and the date and terms of the proposed sale shall be posted.
