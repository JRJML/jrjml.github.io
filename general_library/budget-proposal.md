# General Library
## J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library
### 4.10 Budget Proposal
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Basic Instructions

At the start of the calendar year, the County of Appomattox issues the following documents to the departments:

- Five-year expenditure summary
- Request for the next Fiscal Year's annual budget. 

At around September the Library of Virginia posts the following document to the [Extranet][2]]:
- Upcoming Fiscal Year [State Aid Estimate][4]

It is the responsibility of the Library Director, in cooperation with the Library Board, to create a line-item budget proposal based on 
- The five-year expenditure summary
- Any major predicted increases in expenditure
- Any increases or decreases in state aid

The Libary Director must prepare and submit a budget proposal to County Administration annually by January outlining expected expenditure for the upcoming year.

#### Budget Proposal Format

The budget to be presented to the County Adminstrator should contain the following:

- Coverletter describing the calculation at which the bottom line was reached.

- A copy of the [State Aid Estimate][4]

- The five-year expenditure summary with the upcoming year's figures entered in the appropriate column

- Any documentation justifying any increase in expenditure over and above any increase in state aid

#### State Aid Requirements

In order to recieve important State Aid grants the Library must satisfy all [State Aid Requirements][1].

Requirement one is fairly straight-forward and ensures that each Library systems receives only one grant.

Requirement two is the requirement for documentation. Each year the Director is responsible for submitting up-to-date documentation. These are to be submitted according to the [Documentation Schedule][3]

Requirement three has to do with the budget. Particular attention must be paid to Requirement 3 to ensure that the appropriate starting budget is tallied. The Director must ensure to account for any increase or decrease in State Aid. For example, when applying for "level-funding", the Library must actually ask for more if their state aid goes up, or ask for less if the state aid goes down, in order to comply with state aid requirements.

The rest of the requirements are a variety of programming, scheduling, procedural, and coverage criteria. Failure to comply with any one of the requirements could easily result in the Library losing State Aid. Libraries may submit a waiver to the Library of Virginia's Library Development and Networking Division along with evidence of effort/progress toward meeting the requirement. The State Library Board may elect to approve or deny such a waiver based on said evidence, and enact remediation or penalty.
