2. All groups must register by completing a Meeting Room Application form before their initial meeting. Once this form is completed and approved by the Library Director, users may schedule additional meeting times. Groups must re-register annually.

3. The Meeting Room may not be used for commercial purposes; admission may not be charged nor private enterprise be directly promoted.
