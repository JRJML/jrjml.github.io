- to strengthen partnerships between the Library and the wider community.

#### Criteria for Selection:

All exhibits, whether generated by Library staff or the public, will be considered in terms of the standards listed below. Not all exhibits will meet all standards. Responsibility for the selection of exhibits rests with the Library Director. Criteria include:

- subject, technique, and style are suitable for intended audience
- vitality, originality, and artistic expression
- appropriateness to special events, anniversaries, holidays, etc.
- historical or regional relevance
- relation to other events or exhibits in the community
- ease of installation

Exhibits of discriminatory nature will be refused. If elements of a display are judged inappropriate by members of the Library Board and/or the Library Director, the sponsoring individual will be required to remove those elements immediately.

#### Guidelines for Exhibits

1. Library-initiated exhibits will be given priority.

3. Exhibits are scheduled for the period of several months.

4. Transporting, unloading, hanging, arrangement, and dismantling of exhibits shall be the responsibility of the artist under the supervision of the Library staff.

All reasonable precautions will be taken to protect exhibits, but the Library cannot be responsible for reimbursement or replacement of lost, stolen, or damaged materials. Exhibitors must sign a waiver of liability holding the Library, its employees and trustees, and the County harmless for any damage to loaned material.

No exhibit material which is sold during its display in the library may be removed before the end of hte exhibition period.

9. Granting of permission to use Library facilities does not constitute an endorsement by the Library staff, the Library Board of Trustees, or the County of Appomattox, of the content of the Exhibit, the materials exhibited, or the Exhibitor(s).

10. Failure to fulfill these requirements could result in denial of future Library exhibits.
