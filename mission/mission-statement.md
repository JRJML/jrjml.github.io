### 1.1 Mission Statement
[< Table of Contents][0]

The mission of the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is to provide the population of Appomattox County with access to knowledge, ideas, and creative expression by collecting and offering print resources, audio-visual materials, and electronic information services which are of interest to the community; to assure the ease of access to these materials; and to provide programs to stimulate the awareness and use of these resources by establishing access to human informational and creative resources of Appomattox County and beyond. The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library offers a welcoming and inspiring environment for learning and promotes individual enlightenment and community enrichment throughout the region.

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library pursues its mission for purposes which reflect the objectives of the individual people using the Library. These purposes may be characterized as educational, informational, and recreational. The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library has four primary roles:

1. Popular Materials Library - The Library provides current materials of high interest in a variety of formats for persons of all ages.
2. Reference Library - The Library provides timely, accurate information and reference services employing a highly qualified staff who provide the link between library materials and users in a congenial and professional manner.
3. Education Support and Independent Learning Center - The Library supports the educational goals of all citizens of Appomattox County by providing the resources which correspond to their diverse needs.
4. Preschool and School-Age Children's Library - The Library also encourages young children to develop a love of reading, learning, and libraries by providing materials and programs for children, as well as for their parents and caregivers.

As an institution which helps individuals develop their own convictions and pursue personal opportunities, the Library plays an important role in the operation of a free and democratic society. Serving students of all ages, teachers, homeschoolers, preschool, and daycare children, the Library is a part of the educational structure of the community. Although the Library serves primarily residents, it directly or indirectly serves the entire fabric of the community, including local government, clubs, and organizations, business and industry, and educational, social service, artistic, and religious institutions. The diverse nature of the community is reflected in the collections and services of the Library.

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library serves people of all ages, backgrounds, and persuasions, respecting their individual library needs. The Library, therefore, provides and does not restrict access to facts, ideas, and creative expression, unless restricted by law, to any person regardless of age, background, or persuasion who is a member of the community served. The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library upholds the public's freedom of access to knowledge.
